## Abstract

I led the creation of Toll Brothersâ€™ first digital design system. It involved two main efforts. The first is extensive research into current design systems thinking. This research ensured a solid understanding of best practices to consider. The second is carefully canonizing our design assets and practices.

## Background

Toll Brothers is a homebuilder with a portfolio of new home communities across 24 states that market to homebuyers seeking luxury at a wide range of price points. Toll Brothers maintains a national brand while marketing their homes through a myriad of sub-brands.
